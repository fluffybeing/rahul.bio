Moving to a new country in late twenties is like going to a high school as an adult. All teenagers are
confused why you are here and you are trying to reconcile your mind that it is a good decision.

I moved to Stockholm without doing much research on my side. The reason being that I moved around a lot since kid and so for me
adapting a new place hasn't been a challenge. My only requirement was that I should not know anyone at that place. It like
rebuilding your life again. Is it?

Why I wanted to do that? Honestly, I don't have clear recollection of why I took that decision. I was trying to recover from
sever year old relationship and felt this was the right path. Did it help? In short yes but not without huge challenges.
Moving to new place take your mind off but the inner struggle still lies there. I have realized there is no escape to that. You
might be good at tackling strong emotions at the beginning itself, I fall into the later one. I defer own emotional challenges
as much as I can until it spiral up in my life that I have no escape.
