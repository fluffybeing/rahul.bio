Moving to a new country in your late twenties is akin to attending high school as an adult.
The teenagers around you are perplexed by your presence, while you are simultaneously trying to convince yourself
that this decision is indeed the right one.

Whenever I hang out with people, the ice-breaker would invariably be along the lines of,
"When did you move to [Stockholm](https://www.visitstockholm.com/)? How long have you been living here? Do you like it?"
The typical response would be that it is a beautiful city, but the weather and the perceived coldness of the people are often criticized.
Since I never took the time to explore why I personally like Stockholm, I would simply nod in agreement. It never felt right to me.
It was as if I was adopting someone else's opinions, which I neither believed in nor agreed with.

I moved to Stockholm without conducting much research on aspects like weather or culture.
Having moved around frequently since childhood, adapting to a new place had never been a challenge for me.
However, isn't it true that our confidence can be shattered quite quickly? My only requirement
before moving was that I should be a complete stranger in a new city to experience the process of rebuilding my life anew.

Why did I want to do that? Honestly, I don't have a clear recollection of why I made that decision.
I was trying to recover from a seven-year-old relationship breakup and felt this was the right path. Did it help?
In short, yes, but not without significant challenges. Moving to a new place can initially distract you from your troubles,
but it can also create a false perception of resolution, while the inner struggle persists with no real escape.
In essence, I tend to defer my emotional challenges as much as possible until they spiral out of control, leaving me with no way out.

To rewind a bit, I was living in [Singapore](https://www.visitsingapore.com/) before moving to Stockholm in August 2020. If I had to describe Singapore
in one word, it would be **Convenient**.

I have never been to a city that comes close to Singapore.

- Easy to get around with public transport
- 24/7 food availability
- Almost no crime
- Squeaky clean everywhere
- Highly cosmopolitan
- Decent weather (I appreciate the 🌞)

The initial two years in Stockholm were a struggle for me. It challenged me in every possible way,
from basic life skills to the values I live by. The basic skills included learning how to layer for winter
and how to cook most of my meals etc. On the values side, I learned how to be happy being alone,
how to be content with what I have, and how to appreciate a slower pace of life.

One of the most beautiful experiences during those years was meeting some of the most wonderful people and
having the good fortune to become friends with them. Additionally,
Stockholm provided me with the opportunity to fully immerse myself in my hobbies, offering ample time to focus on them.
It is also one of the reasons I was able to start this blog.

I can't sum up Stockholm in one word, but I will attempt to do so in a sentence.

A city to experience; to experience yourself.
