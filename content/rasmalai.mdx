Just a normal Tuesday, I went for a run, came back took shower, ate two protein nut bar,
packed two year old macbook in my bag and then took the [Roslagsbanan](https://sl.se/reseplanering/var-trafik/roslagsbanan) to the office.

While sitting there, my mind was fidgeting to do something as my eyes are not fond of wintery vibe i.e. worn out trees, grayish sky and there is no sign of life. And so I though
 of playing some games or reading that Network protocol article or write my weekly pending post. While my mind was hopping
over these options suddenly it reminded me of my childhood friend Bablu and took me into a trickled down memory of having **Rasmalai** at our favorite sweet shop in
the home town.

To give you description of #Rasmalai. In Hindi, "ras" means juice, and "malai" means cream. In essence, rasmalai consists of soft and creamy chenna (cottage cheese) dumplings soaking in sweetened, flavored milk full of nuts. As the dumplings soak, they absorb the milk, becoming juicy and are infused with its rich flavor.

The picture makes me so nostalgic. I wish I could have a teleportation device which I can use to visit the sweet shop and slurp it right now. Wishes ahhh!

I only visit my home town once a year and every year has occupied a different theme and going through the memory lanes and made me realise my conversation were aligned with those theme.
