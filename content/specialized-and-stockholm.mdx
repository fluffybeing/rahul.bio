I was recovering from depression, a common challenge you face as you transition into adulthood. The times has changed and managing life is not easy.
As a pun I believe trauma happens because brain can't navigate complexity and it tries to do things which you don't want i.e. want to sleep, no you can't.
You have think about what why someone said things the way they said. I have written about this reflection in detail [here](/blog/cycling-hobby).
So, to keep things short, I was eager to restart my 🚴 routine in Stockholm to feel good about myself.
I was never drawn by its many [benefits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21496106/).

## Why now?

I currently live in Stockholm, which is a beautiful city. FYI, I will write good things which gives iffy vibe because at the beginning I dreadfully hated this
place for the initial two years and then fell in love with it. It seems to me that
Stockholm did [`Stockholm Syndrome`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) to me.

Anyways, moving on, If you live in Stockholm, you need to consider two factors before buying your beloved bicycle.

- Storage
- Weather

### Storage

Stockholm is notorious for [bicycle theft](https://bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/swedish-crime-survey.html),
which made me hesitant to get a bike when I moved from Singapore to Sweden in August 2020. I was really really tempted to buy one,
but my apartment building didn’t have bike storage inside, and my unit was on the sixth floor, taking bike in and out is out of question here.
Even if I bought it, I knew that would mean I'd never use it. Fortunately, my new apartment has both a large lift and access to a bike garage room,
which means storage issue is kind of resolved. This took away major worry of my bike getting stolen.

BTW, I keep my bike inside my apartment for better sleep 😴.

### Weather

Ask anyone about Stockholm's weather, and you'll likely get a [less-than-enthusiastic](https://studyinsweden.se/blogs/2020/02/24/the-horrifying-the-unbearable-the-terrible-swedish-winter/) response.
It's true—more than eight months of the year are rainy, dark, or too cold.
I used to think I could only cycle during the three summer months, leaving my bike unused for
the rest of the year.

However, I've realized that even those three months are incredibly valuable, and with the right gear,
I can extend my cycling season for a few more months. Now, I'm eager to make the most of every ride,
regardless of the weather!

## Cycling in Stockholm

Cycling in Stockholm is a delight (particularly gravel paths for me), though the city's traffic can sometimes feel overwhelming.
Fortunately, the meticulously designed bike paths offer serene alternatives to main roads,
guiding you through scenic routes along waterfronts and parks. The city boasts extensive bike lanes and
a strong commitment to sustainability, enhancing your ride. You can explore a variety of routes,
including gravel paths, trails, and roads, using [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/guide/61830/cycling-in-stockholm)
or [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net/en/l/2673730/).

Stockholm also offers the convenience of taking your bike on ferries and trains. For more details,
check [here](https://sl.se/en/in-english/getting-around/bikes-on-board/).
Just remember that bikes are permitted on commuter trains(pendaltåg) but not on the Tunnelbana.

## Choosing the cycle

I can't say enough about Specialized Vado SL, I just love this bike. To give you the background, the Vado SL has been on my mind since last
year when I accompanied a friend on his search for a new bike. During our visits to various bike shops,
I discovered the Vado SL and was immediately impressed. However, at that time, it was priced at 40,000 SEK,
which was a bit out of my budget. This year, I was thrilled to see it on sale, and I finally seized the opportunity to make it mine.

### Vado SL 4.0 EQ

Given Stockholm’s hilly terrain, I knew that a regular bike would leave me feeling exhausted constantly, so I decided to look into e-bikes.
To be honest, I went with the e-bike because my friend had one and so that I can go on ride with him.
But I also wanted one of the lightest e-bike, just in case the battery runs out and I need to ride it like a regular bike then I should be able
to do that. The Vado SL 4.0 turned out to be a perfect fit, weighing just over 15 kg, which makes it easy to carry and handle without assist.

You can read about the detailed specification [here](https://www.specialized.com/se/sv/shop/cyklar/stadscyklar/e-turbo-vado).

Below is the pic of the bike just after picking it from the [Specialized concept store](https://www.scsgbg.se/).

Also I would recommend to have a bike fit done for you if you want to ride for long distances. To give you an estimate about the sizing.

I am 183CM tall and my bike size is `L` which fit well to me.

## Why Specialized?

I am not here to give the detailed review of the cycle as I don't considered myself as an expert. This is just my own thoughts and views
about it after riding it for 500 KMs. When you purchase your Specialized bicycle, you can register
it in the [app](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/app) to ensure your lifetime warranty.

Also, I found the app quite user-friendly and appreciate its ability to connect with various services.
I've linked mine with [Garmin](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/0c0e9682-cd03-443c-b376-27cfc6ba3fd9)
and [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12576125).

The home dashboard of the App is elegant and covers the functionality quite well. It
offers convenient access to essential information, including battery status, tuning, and ride recording.

- One of the things I didn't like about the App is that sometimes the cycle gets unpaired randomly I have to go through bluetooth
  pairing process again.

To record your ride, you must start it manually, as the bike does not initiate recording automatically,
though the odometer will continue to count. This likely conserves phone battery, as recording relies on the phone’s GPS.

</Callout>

In the app's rides section, you can view all your rides and access crucial data points,
such as distance, elevation, speed, power, and battery consumption.

## Experience after 500KM

With each kilometer, my connection with the bike grew stronger. The Swedish summer has been perfect for cycling,
as the cool temperatures make for comfortable rides all day long. In just three weeks, I covered my first 500 kilometers,
exploring both the city and its outskirts. Every ride has been a joy, revealing new sights and making each journey even more rewarding.

I love how well the bike handles both on roads and trails. I've reached speeds of 55 km/h and still felt completely balanced.
While it doesn't have the front suspension of a mountain bike, it’s still capable on trails, even if it’s not meant for flying stunts.
It also provides just enough power to help me climb steep hills effortlessly.

## Moving forward

I've rekindled my love for cycling, which has become essential for maintaining my mental health.
Looking ahead, I'm considering the following pursuits:

#### Joining group rides in Stockholm

1. [Gravel Bike Sweden](https://www.strava.com/clubs/567025)
2. [Södermalm cycling club](https://www.sodermalmafc.se/cycling-club/)

#### Joining races

I have already signed for [Vätternrundan](https://vatternrundan.se/vatternrundan100km/sv/) 100 km race for 2025. In the
meantime, I am looking forward for small races around Stockholm such as [STHLMBike](https://sthlmbike.se/).

#### Solo bike packing

With summer drawing to a close, I will plan for the solo bike trip next year.
