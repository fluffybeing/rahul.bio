I started skiing in 2020, and I have been to a few ski resorts in Sweden and Norway. Most of my trips has been with friends, and I have been fortunate to have some great ski buddies who are expert Ski navigator until this year when I decided to go on slopes alone in [Trysil](https://www.trysil.com/en/), Norway. I was a bit nervous as Trysil is too big, but I like unknowns in life and finding my way around it.

## Being lost in slopes

I collected my equipments from the Ski rental around 8:00 AM in the morning. Also, was bit proud to find the right fitting shoes in first trial. I had a nice warm coffee and headed for my first run. My plan was to take green and blue slopes to just warm up and rekindle my skiing skills. 

I took the `T2` chair lift as it was nearest and reached to the middle of the mountain. It was extremely cold i.e. `-15Â°C` and quite windy. After getting down from the lift, I had no clue where to go. If you look at the map, you will see that only green slope from there is `14`. 

> Isn't it true that we get call into adventure when we least wanted.

Without planning ahead, I just took the green slope (`14`) and started skiing. If you closely look at the map, it later combines with green slope (`67`) and goes through really cross country like route through cabins and take you to the button lift (`S7`) which is left most part of the mountain.

But instead of going to the left, I was so pissed off with the route because it was like a cross country ski path that I decided in mid-way that I should cut through cabins and join which ever the adjacent slope I can find. Smart move, right?

Following that pink drawn line on the map took more than 3 hours for me. I got extremely tired and exhausted. I was lost in the woods and had no clue where I was going. I was just following the noise and lights.
