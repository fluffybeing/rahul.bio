India is a fascinating country! I say this because of its sheer diversity in people, culture, religion, language, and geography. I am not a historian, linguist, or geologist in any capacity to describe it academically, but with my limited experience, I want to share some perspectives about the country by framing it in two major categories:

1. Zoomed-out 
2. Zoomed-in 

These perspectives stem from my childhood and early twenties spent there, followed by my experiences in different parts of the world. I have been asked numerous times by people interested in India. Some typical questions include:

* Does arranged marriage still happen?
* Is India dirty?
* Does the caste system still exist? 
* And so on...

If you are looking for a simple YES/NO answer, the response to all of the above is YES. In comparison to the Western world, most answers tend to lean towards the negative side due to developmental differences. If you are satisfied with an objective answer, you can move on, but if you wish to explore things in greater depth and with a more subjective lens, feel free to join me!

I also want to share this so that you can gain a better understanding of the complexities that range across society, economy, religion, and how they interplay. Itâ€™s like knowing the nuts and bolts and then using that knowledge to see how a motor engine works. Perhaps your next visit to India will be easier. 

## Zoomed-out India 
Zoomed-out India is idyllic. It checks all the boxes of what we expect from a prospering and evolving society. Here are some highlights:
* Cradle of civilization[^1]
* Culturally and linguistically diverse (more than 19,000 dialects)[^2] 
* Becoming a richer nation[^3]
* Democratic
* ... and many more positive adjectives you can think of.

## Zoomed-in India
Zoomed-in India is sorrowful. I am not trying to exaggerate here. If you have been to India or even if you haven't, just search for India with any of the following captions online, and you will feel it. The inhumane aspects are extreme, and some to mention are:
* Caste system[^4]: Unequal from birth.
* Poverty and hunger[^5]: One-third of the world's poor live in India.
* Corruption[^6]: It is pervasive, from top to bottom.
* Pollution: Air, water, land, noise, lightâ€”you name it.
* ... and countless more negative adjectives you can think of.

## Co-existence of Zoomed-out and Zoomed-in India
The interplay of these two sides is what makes India so unique. Unlike other places where distinctions are clear, in India, they are not. For example, letâ€™s say you are a millionaire from a **lower** caste; you will still have less social [status](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service) than a poor person from a **higher** caste. Mixing in other variables like language, region, and religion can shift the dynamics in entirely different directions.

Another example: animals often have more rights than humans. If you kill a cow, you could be lynched, but if you kill a human, you might get away with it.

Currently, I live in Sweden, where status is more egalitarian. No individual can disrespect or treat others poorly.

Status here is not related to how ethical an individual is. In India, it is more about who has more authority over others.
</Callout>

Simply put, many variables in society create this complex, chaotic system, and thus paradoxes thrive in India. I have heard many good and bad things about India while living abroad, and I can say that all are true. 

> It is a country of 1.4 billion people, so it is bound to have all the flavors.

Therefore, understanding or being aware that the parameters for success, failure, happiness, sadness, friendships, etc., are different in India is crucial. Itâ€™s like playing a game where the rules vary for different players. Why it is like this is a whole different topic, and I will leave it for another post.

## Concrete examples
I would love to share some on-ground examples to help you navigate through the complexities of India. 

### Time 
In India, time is not linear, and people do not respect it (whether rich or poor). Letâ€™s say you have a bus to catch, and for some reason, it gets delayed or even canceled; then you are on your own. You might get a refund, but you will not receive any compensation for your time. This is evident in all walks of life.

At the same time, a stranger might help you in the middle of the night if you are in trouble.

### Civic sense 
Another pet peeve of mine. Civic sense in India is often limited to oneâ€™s home. Beyond their home, people generally do not care about cleanliness, traffic rules, noise pollution, etc. It feels like a free-for-all.

You will find the dirtiest street in front of a billionaire's house.

There are many more examples like this, but I hope the above two give you a sense of how values differ.

## Conclusion
Through this post, I wanted to share my perspective on India using the Zoomed-out and Zoomed-in categories to reflect the existing paradoxes and how society still thrives. I hope this post provides you with food for thought whenever you hear about India.
